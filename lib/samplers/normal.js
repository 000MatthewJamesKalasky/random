/**
 * The normal distribution (aka Gaussian) is parameterized by its mean
 * and variance and is referred to as the standard normal distribution when
 * when it has mean zero and variance one. The normal distribution is
 * probably the single most important distribution in all of probability
 * because of its ubiquity in describing natural phenomena and because of the
 * Central Limit Theorem, which says that the sum of a sufficiently large
 * number of iid random variables, each with finite mean and varirance, will
 * be approximately normally distributed.  This allows one to study almost
 * any distribution in terms of one, standard normal, distribution, simplifying
 * many computations and proofs all over both applied and theoretical
 * statistics.
